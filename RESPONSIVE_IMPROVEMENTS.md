- Mobile: Reduced padding (8px-24px)
- Large screens: Increased padding (60px-200px)
- Better viewport utilization across all screen sizes

### 3. Dynamic Positioning System
- Top shift now uses clamp() for fluid responsiveness
- Mobile: Reduced vertical offset (-5vmin to -2vmin)
- Large screens: Increased vertical offset (-25vmin to -10vmin)
- Tall screens: Optimized positioning for better vertical space usage

### 4. Responsive Card Scaling
- All cards now use CSS variable-based scaling (--card-scale)
- Font sizes use responsive variables:
  - --big-num-size: 24px-72px range
  - --stat-size: 16px-36px range
  - --label-size: 12px-24px range
- Card padding uses --card-padding variable (8px-32px range)

### 5. Improved Line System

- Mobile: Shorter lines (45% height)
- Large screens: Extended lines (70-75% height)
- Tall screens: Even longer lines (65-85% height)
- L-shaped connector widths: 60-80% range based on screen size

### 6. Enhanced Visual Elements

- Gap spacing: All use clamp() for fluid adjustments

### 7. Statistics and Labels
- All text elements use responsive font variables
- Consistent spacing with viewport-relative units
- Mobile-optimized row gaps and column spacing
- Better text readability across all screen sizes

### 8. Performance Optimizations

- Centralized responsive logic in single hook
- CSS variables reduce recalculation overhead
- Maximum container size limits prevent excessive scaling

## Usage

The component now automatically adapts to different screen sizes without any additional props or configuration. All responsive behavior is handled internally through the enhanced `useResponsiveVars` hook and CSS variables.

```jsx
// No changes needed in usage
<EmpFlowchart images={imageProps} />
```

The component will automatically detect screen size and apply appropriate responsive styles for optimal viewing on any device.
